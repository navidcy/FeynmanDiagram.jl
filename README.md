`FeynmanDiagram.jl` is a Julia package designed to efficiently encode Feynman diagrams --- essential elements of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) â€”-- into compact computational graphs for fast evaluation. It employs Taylor-mode Automatic Differentiation (AD) specifically to implement field-theoretic renormalization schemes, a pivotal technique in QFT that significantly improves the convergence of Feynman diagrammatic series. This approach underscores the synergy between QFT and AI technologies, effectively addressing the sophisticated computational challenges in QFT.

## Key Features

- **Computational Graphs for Feynman Diagrams**: Utilizes computational graphs analogous to those in Machine Learning (ML) architectures, where nodes represent mathematical operations and edges denote the tensor flow.
  
- **Compiler Architecture**: Implements a three-stage compiler process, analogous to modern programming language compilers, to transform Feynman diagrams into executable code, significantly enhancing the adaptability and computational efficiency of QFT calculations.

- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Bridges QFT and AI tech stack by adapting ML algorithms, such as Taylor-mode AD, for QFT calculations, enhancing computational efficiency with tools like JAX, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Mindspore.

## Compiler Architecture Overview

In general, Feynman diagrams represents high-order integral. The integrand are propagators/interactions composed by the basis arithmetic operations (multiplication, addition, power, etc). The sequence of calculating the integrand by combining the propagators/interactions with the arithmetic operatos can be represented as an algebraic computational graph. In this sense, the computational graph serves as an intermediate representation that standardizes the treatment of various diagram types, ensuring a consistent approach across different QFT calculations.

Based on these insights, the compiler's architecture is designed to process Feynman diagrams via a structured, three-stage procedure, mirroring the design principles of the advanced LLVM compiler architecture. This strategy not only broadens the compiler's versatility for diverse QFT computations but also markedly enhances its computational efficiency. The procedure unfolds in three distinct stages:

- **Front End**: This initial phase generates Feynman diagrams and converts them into a unified intermediate representation, shaping them as static computational graphs. It offers flexibility for users to introduce new diagrammatic techniques by extending the front end capabilities.

- **Intermediate Representation**: At this stage, the compiler applies optimizations and AD to the static computational graph, facilitating thorough analysis and refinement. The optimizations aim to streamline the graph by eliminating redundant elements, flattening nested chains, and removing zero-valued nodes, among other enhancements. The Taylor-mode AD --- an algorithm for efficient high-order derivatives calculations --- is crucial for deriving specific heat diagrams, RG flow equations, or renormalized Feynman diagrams.

- **Back End**: The final phase focuses on converting the optimized graph into executable code, compatible with a wide range of computing environments. This stage supports various programming languages and ensures seamless integration with different software and hardware ecosystems, thereby extending the compiler's utility across multiple platforms.

## Usage

### Installation

To install the package, you can simply use the following command in the Julia package manager:

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("FeynmanDiagram.jl")
```

### Example: Weak Coupling Expansion with Parquet Algorithm

This algorithm generates Feynman diagrams for weak coupling expansions, supporting various diagram types, such as self-energy, polarization, 3-point vertex function, and 4-point vertex function. The internal degrees of freedom can be either the loop variables (e.g., momentum or frequency) or the site variables (e.g., imaginary-time or lattice site). The main idea of the algorithm is to use the parquet equation to build high-order-vertex-function diagrams from the lower order sub-diagrams. 

The example below demonstrates generating one-loop 4-point vertex function diagrams and visualizing their computational graph.

```julia
using FeynmanDiagram
import FeynmanDiagram.FrontEnds: NoHartree, Girreducible

# Define a parameter structure for a 4-vertex diagram with one-loop in the momentum and the imaginary-time representation. Require the diagrams to be green's function irreducible.
para = Parquet.DiagPara(type = Parquet.Ver4Diag, innerLoopNum = 1, hasTau = true, filter=[NoHartree, Girreducible,])

# Generate the Feynman diagrams in a DataFrame using the parquet algorithm. `ver4df` is a DataFrame containing fields :response, :type, :extT, :diagram, and :hash.
ver4df = Parquet.build(para) 

ver4df_extT = Parquet.mergeby(ver4df, [:extT], name=:vertex4) # merge the Feynman diagrams in a DataFrame with the same `extT` field.

optimize!(ver4df_extT.diagram) # optimize the Graph for the given Feynman diagrams.

ver4 = ver4df_extT.diagram[1]
plot_tree(ver4) # visualize the generated first Feynman diagram and its computational graph using ete3.
```

The generated computational graph is as shown in the following figure. The leaves of the tree are the propagators (labeled with `G`) and the interactions (labeled with `Ins`). By default, the interactions is assumed to spin-symmetric. A typical example is the Coulomb interaction.

### Computational Graph visualization
Install the [ete3](http://etetoolkit.org/) Python package for visualization.

Note that we rely on [PyCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) to call the ete3 python functions from julia. Therefore, you have to install ete3 python package use the python distribution associated with PyCall. According to the tutorial of PyCall, "by default on Mac and Windows systems, Pkg.add("PyCall") or Pkg.build("PyCall") will use the Conda.jl package to install a minimal Python distribution (via Miniconda) that is private to Julia (not in your PATH). You can use the Conda Julia package to install more Python packages, and import Conda to print the Conda.PYTHONDIR directory where python was installed. On GNU/Linux systems, PyCall will default to using the python3 program (if any, otherwise python) in your PATH."
